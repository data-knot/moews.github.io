Hi! I'm Ben, and I'm a first-year PhD Student in Astrophysics at the University of Edinburgh's School of Physics and Astronomy. I'm a Participant of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), an accredited Graduate Statistician with the American Statistical Association and a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Due to my background in and reliance on machine learning, I'm essentially a 'machine cosmologist'.
