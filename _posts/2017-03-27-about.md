I am a PhD student in Astrophyics at the University of Edinburgh's School of Physics & Astronomy and the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance Graduate School, a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and a Graduate Statistician with the Royal Statistical Society. My studies are funded by the Principal's Career Development Scholarship.

While honorifics and post-nominal letters have a nice ring to them, I prefer 'Ben' in all introductions and correspondence, both written and face-to-face. (And if you now think: 'So ... what about a phone call?', I might like you.

I previously worked in Audi's R&D branch on acoustic signal processing and machine learning for high-pressure die casting machines, and as a research engineer in the AI & Machine Learning Group at Baillie Gifford, where I was responsible for the development of machine learning approaches to long-term financial asset management.
