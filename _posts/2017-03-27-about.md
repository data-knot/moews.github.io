I am a PhD student in Astrophysics and Principal's Career Development Scholar at the University of Edinburgh's School of Physics & Astronomy, a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, a Member of the Dark Energy Survey and, with a Master's in Artificial Inteligence, an accredited Graduate Statistician with both the Royal Statistical Society and the American Statistical Association.

My industrial experience started with work on automated acoustics-based fault detection for high-pressure die casting machines in Germany's automotive sector, and I worked as a research engineer for machine learning in the UK's investment management sector before my PhD studies. I also founded and currently lead Data Knot, a data science company at the University of Edinburgh.
