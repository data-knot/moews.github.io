I am a PhD student in Astrophysics and Principal's Career Development Scholar at the University of Edinburgh's School of Physics & Astronomy, a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and an accredited Graduate Statistician with both the Royal Statistical Society and the American Statistical Association. I also founded and lead Data Knot, a data science company at the University of Edinburgh.

With a previous MSc in Artificial Intelligence, my research is centred on the intersection of machine learning, computational astrophysics and cosmology; and I am stationed at the new Higgs Centre for Innovation at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. I also collaborate with the University of Edinburg's School of Mathematics on machine learning and statistics for gravitational wave detectors.

My industrial experience started with work on automated acoustic fault detection for high-pressure die casting machinery in Germany's automotive sector. Before my PhD studies, I was a research engineer in the UK's investment management sector, developing models to outperform global stock markets over multi-year intervals. In my spare time, I scream into a microphone at ᛊᚢᚾᛞ, an Edinburgh-based black metal band.
