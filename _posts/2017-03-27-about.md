I am a PhD student in Astrophyics at the University of Edinburgh's School of Physics & Astronomy and the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance Graduate School, a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, a Graduate Statistician with the Royal Statistical Society and a recipient of the Principal's Career Development Scholarship. While honorifics and post-nominal letters may have a nice ring to them, I prefer 'Ben' in all introductions and correspondence, both written and face-to-face.

I previously worked in Audi's R&D branch on acoustic signal processing and machine learning for high-pressure die casting machines, and as a research engineer in the AI & Machine Learning Group at Baillie Gifford, where I was responsible for the development of machine learning approaches to long-term financial asset management. I am always open to collaborations for research on interesting topics, so feel free to have a look at the corresponding section of this page.
