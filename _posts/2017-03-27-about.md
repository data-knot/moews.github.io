Hi! I'm Ben, and I'm a first-year PhD student in astrophysics and Principal's Career Development Scholar at the University of Edinburgh's School of Physics and Astronomy. With a previous master's degree in artificial intelligence and a specialization in machine learning, I'm also an accredited Graduate Statistician with the American Statistical Association. Due to the influence of statistics and machine learning on my research, I'm essentially a 'machine cosmologist'. ðŸ™‚
