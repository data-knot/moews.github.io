## A quick introduction

I am a PhD student in Astrophyics at the University of Edinburgh's School of Physics & Astronomy and the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance Graduate School, a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and a Graduate Statistician with the Royal Statistical Society. While honorifics and post-nominal letters have a nice ring to them, I prefer 'Ben' in all introductions and correspondence, both written and face-to-face. (And if you now think: 'So ... what about a phone call?', I might like you.)

## Background and work

With a background encompassing a BSc in Business Administration and an MSc in Artificial Intelligence, my academic trajectory has the tendency to seem slightly weird. My work experience includes research on acoustic signal processing and machine learning for high-pressure die casting machines in Audi's R&D branch, as well as my most recent role as a research engineer in the AI & Machine Learning Group at Baillie Gifford, where I was responsible for the development of machine learning approaches to long-term financial asset management.
