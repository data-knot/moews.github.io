My research interests are mostly centered on the intersection of cosmology, astrostatistics and machine learning. Specifically, I'm interested in dark matter and weak lensing, gravitational waves and cosmological inference / cosmological parameter estimation, with a strong methodological love for deep learning models and nonparametric statistics, especially Bayesian nonparametrics. In these areas, I work primarily with my supervisor at the Institute for Astronomy, Joe Zuntz.

Apart from my DES-related work, I also collaborate with Romeel Dav√©'s research group on the equilibrium model for galaxy formation and evolution, as well as on machine learning for financial economics as related to time series analysis and lagged correlations with Professor Gbenga Ibikunle in the Finance Group of the University of Edinburgh Business School.
