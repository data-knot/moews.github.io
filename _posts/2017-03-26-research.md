My primary research areas are centred on the intersection of artificial intelligence and physics, especially computational astrophysics and cosmology combined with cutting-edged machine learning methodology. Fields in which I take a special interest are gravitational lensing and dark matter, cosmological parameter estimation, synthetic callibration samples and models, and galaxy morphological classification.

Other fields in which I publish in collaboration with researchers from the University of Edinburgh's Business School and School of Informatics, as well as UCL's Financial Computing & Analytics Group, are neural networks, stock market analysis and financial economics. If you are interested in a research collaboration for a paper in the areas mentioned on this page, feel free to drop me an email.
