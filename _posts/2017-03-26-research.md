My research interests are mostly centered on the intersection of cosmology, astrostatistics and machine learning. Specifically, I'm interested in dark matter and weak lensing, gravitational waves and cosmological inference / cosmological parameter estimation, with a strong methodological love for deep learning models and nonparametric statistics, especially Bayesian ones.

Apart from my DES-related work, I'm also working with Professor Romeel Dav√©'s research group on the equilibrium model for galaxy formation and evolution, as well as on machine learning for financial economics with Professor Gbenga Ibikunle at the University of Edinburgh Business School's Finance Group.
