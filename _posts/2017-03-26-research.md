My primary research areas are centred on cosmology, computational astrophysics and machine learning. More specifically, I am interested in weak gravitational lensing and dark matter distribution, cosmological parameter estimation, galaxy morphological classification and noise calibration for telescopes. More generally, I take personal pleasure in reinforcing people's fear of AI.

In addition, I work with the University of Edinburgh's School of Mathematics on machine learning and statistics for gravitational wave detectors. Other fields in which I collaborate with the University of Edinburgh's Business School and School of Informatics, as well as UCL's Financial Computing & Analytics Group, are deep learning, stock market analysis and financial economics.
