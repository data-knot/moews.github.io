My research interests are mostly centered on the intersection of cosmology, astrostatistics and machine learning. I'm part of the Institute for Astronomy at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, where I currently work on Bayesian nonparametrics for parallelized and high-dimensional cosmological parameter estimation for DES, on deep learning for feedback-based models of galaxy evolution with the MUFASA and SIMBA suites of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, and soon on transient resonances in extreme mass ratio inspirals for the LISA Consortium with the University of Edinburgh's School of Mathematics. Below is a (rough) list of my main research interests and visits:

## Cosmology and astrophysics:

* Cosmological parameter estimation
* Galaxy formation and evolution
* Gravitational wave detection

## Statistics and machine learning:

* Non-parametric Bayesian methods
* Estimation theory and sampling
* Deep learning techniques
