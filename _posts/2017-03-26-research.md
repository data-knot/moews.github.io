My primary research areas at the School of Physics & Astronomy are centred on cosmology, computational astrophysics and machine learning, with a notable bend towards astrostatistics. I also collaborate with the School of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews on related research, and with the Statistics Group at the School on Mathematics on graviational wave research.

More specifically, my research interests tend to cover the following areas:
<ul class = "stdSize">
<li>Gravitational lensing and dark matter</li>
<li>Cosmological parameter estimation methods</li>
<li>Simulations of galaxy formation and evolution</li>
<li>Statistics for gravitational wave detectors</li>
<li>Noise calibration models for telescopes</li>
</ul>
More generally, I take personal pleasure in reinforcing people's fear of AI.

In addition, I work with both the School of Informatics and the Business School, as well as the Financial Computing & Analytics Group at University College London's School of Computer Science and the University of Hong Kong's Department for Statistics & Actuarial Science on machine learning, especially deep learning architectures, for stock market analysis and financial economics.
