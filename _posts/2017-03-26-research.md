My research interests are mostly centered on the intersection of cosmology, astrostatistics and machine learning. Specifically, I'm interested in dark matter and weak lensing, gravitational waves and cosmological inference / cosmological parameter estimation, with a strong methodological love for deep learning models and nonparametric statistics, especially Bayesian nonparametrics. In these areas, I work primarily with my supervisor at the Institute for Astronomy, Joe Zuntz.

Apart from my DES-related work, I also collaborate with Romeel Dav√©'s research group on the equilibrium model for galaxy formation and evolution, as well as on machine learning for financial economics as related to stock market efficiency and large-scale lagged correlations with Gbenga Ibikunle in the Finance Group at the University of Edinburgh Business School.
