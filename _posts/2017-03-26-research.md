My research interests are mostly centred on the intersection of cosmology, astrostatistics and machine learning. I'm part of the Institute for Astronomy at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, where I currently work on novel probabilistic approaches for parallelized high-dimensional cosmological parameter estimation for DES, on deep learning for feedback-based models of galaxy evolution with the MUFASA and SIMBA suites of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, and on transient resonances in extreme mass ratio inspirals within gravitational wave detection for the LISA Consortium with the University of Edinburgh's School of Mathematics. Below is a (rough) list of my main research interests:

## Cosmology and astrophysics:

* Cosmological parameter estimation
* Galaxy formation and evolution
* Gravitational wave detection

## Statistics and machine learning:

* Non-parametric Bayesian methods
* Estimation theory and sampling
* Deep learning for simulations
