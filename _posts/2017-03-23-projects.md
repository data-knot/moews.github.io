## gaussbock

Fast cosmological parameter estimation with parallel iterative Bayesian nonparametrics!

Current efforts in cosmological parameter estimation often suffer from both the computational costs of approximating distributions in high-dimensional parameter spaces and the wide-spread need for model tuning. With these problems in mind, gaussbock was developed as an easy-to-use tool for embarrassingly parallel high-dimensional posterior approximation with expensive likelihoods.

With a foundation in Bayesian nonparametrics, estimation theory and parallel computing, gaussbock builds on our recent research in iterative sampling procedures and supports both multi-processing for local cluster computing and MPI for external clusters and supercomputers.

To install gaussbock, simply use `pip install gaussbock` in your terminal. Preliminary documentation can be found in the source code's docstrings, with a full documentation and a paper on arXiv currently in preparation.
