Fast cosmological parameter estimation with parallel iterative Bayesian nonparametrics!

Current efforts in cosmological parameter estimation often suffer from both the computational costs of approximating distributions in high-dimensional parameter spaces and the wide-spread need for model tuning. With these contemporary problems in mind, gaussbock was developed as an easy-to-use tool for embarrassingly parallel high-dimensional parameter estimation with expensive likelihoods for the wider astronomy community. It is, however, a general-purpose posterior approximation tool suitable for many applications. In the above picture, next to the project's sublime and serious logo, you can see the iterative fitting process on a 23-dimensional DES Science Verification example.

With a foundation in Bayesian nonparametrics, variational inference, estimation theory and parallel computing, gaussbock builds on our recent research in iterative sampling methods and supports both multi-processing for local cluster computing and MPI for external clusters and supercomputers, without any effort on the user's side. The source code can also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/moews/gaussbock)

Since gaussbock is on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gaussbock/), simply type `pip install gaussbock` in your terminal to install it. This project was developed for Python 3, and the installation process will automatically install any necessary dependencies. Preliminary documentation and a quickstart guide on how to use gaussbock can be found in the source code's docstrings, with a full documentation and a paper on arXiv, as well as for submission in a suitable journal, currently in preparation.
